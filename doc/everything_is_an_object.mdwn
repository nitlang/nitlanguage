# Everything is an Object

In Nit, all data, even primitive stuff like integers and booleans, are objects.
It means :

### They are subtype of Object

    fun foo(o: Object) do print "I am {o}, the {o.class_name}"
    foo(4)    # -> I am 4, the Int
    foo(true) # -> I am true, the Bool

### Their classes can be [[refined|refinement]]

    redef class Int
        fun double: Int do return self * 2
    end
    print 12.double # -> 24

### And it is real

It is not just some automatic boxing (a la Java 1.5).

    var a: Object = 5
    var b: Object = 3 + 2
    print a == b # -> true
    print a is b # -> true
