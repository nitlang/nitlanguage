# On what operating systems Nit is available?

Nit can be successfully compiled (with make) and used on Linux distributions (tried on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora) for 32bit and 64bit architectures; and on other Unix variants (tried on MacOSX and SunOS).

Some peopled tried to use it on Windows trough [[cygwin|http://www.cygwin.com]] but with poor performances.
If you really want to use Nit on windows, you can either try to help the port or use some virtual machine.
