# Sending Code Contributions

Here the rules for contributing

Use the coding style described in [[the manual|/manual/syntax]].

Describe your patches in English with a one-liner summary, a blank line, then an explanation of the problem and the advantages of the solution implemented by the patch.

Sign-off all your patches by including the line "`signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>`" at the end of each patch description. By the signed-off-by tag, you state that you agree with the [[contribution policy]].

Keep patches as clean as possible: have only one concern by patch, do not include unrelated changes in a patch, patch series is not about *how* you developed your solution but about the best way to present your changes.

Check the checklist (bellow) before sending something.

The recommended way to submit your patches is as a [[pull request|https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/]] on the [[nit githup repository|https://github.com/privat/nit]].
Alternatively, we can accept merge request on some Git repository by email, or patches by email.

For some generic information about contributing to a project that uses Git, [[ProGit|http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html]] has a dedicated section.

## Check list

* Each commit have a proper signed-off-by tag.

* Each commit have a proper description

      $ git log --online --check my_branch
      $ git rebase --whitespaces=fix my_base my_branch

* Check the style with [[nitpretty|/tools/nitpretty]]

* Check warnings with [[nitpick -W|/tools/nitpick]]

* Run unit-tests with [[nitunit|/tools/nitunit]]
